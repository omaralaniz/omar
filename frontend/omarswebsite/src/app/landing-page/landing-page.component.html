      <span id="hello">hello</span>, my ultimate goal is to 
      become an Security Engineer (Web Security, hopefully learn more Security as a whole) but before I get to that I am currently 
      focusing on Web Development to deepen my knowledge of how the Internet works. Thus, I am searching for a Full-Stack Engineer 
      position.<br><br>
      While working as Full-Stack, I  will actively work on Web Security and its communities. Dabble with different security tools
      and contribute to ethical hacker forums and repos.
