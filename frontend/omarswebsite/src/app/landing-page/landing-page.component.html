        As software engineer, I have an understanding of computer networks, which, improves functionality and development time of web based projects.

        I try my best to cover all avenues for a solution and ready to accept outside solutionsâ€” even if it proves me wrong. With the abudant amount of experience as 
        a communicator, I have learned that to be successful you must listen to all teammates and clients.
