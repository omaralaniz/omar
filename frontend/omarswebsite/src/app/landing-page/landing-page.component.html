      I can bring leadership to a team, butI am team player. My experience as manager and Scrum Master allowed
      me to actively learn how to communicate effectively with the team. With this acquired skill, team morale and willingness 
      increases, which, leads to better production. Working with both teams of the stack, and clients 
      alike, makes me an excellent liaison between different departments. Being able to collaborate with anyone can proactively keep a 
      project accessible due to everyone understanding. Having multiple perspectives and molding them as one
      is crucial in a group setting. Lastly, having a security first mentality ultimately causes fast production because there will 
      not be a need to extensively refactor to meet security standards. With that being said, I am always improving and optimizing 
      my current and past projects to reflect my growth.
