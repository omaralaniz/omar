        As software engineer, I have a security first mentality which is important for fast production of secured projects.
        Enjoying the destroying and building (reverse engineering) of projects is something I thoroughly love doing; it is essentially a puzzle to me. 
        <br>---<br>
        I try my best to cover all avenues for a solution and ready to accept outside solutionsâ€” even if it proves me wrong. With the abudant amount of experience as 
        a communicator I have learned that to be successful you must listen to all teammates and clients.
